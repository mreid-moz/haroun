Haroun
======

A collection of the code snippets I find myself continually re-writing.

The name `Haroun` comes from the children's book
[Haroun and the Sea of Stories][1] and is also the name of [my cat][2].

`Files`
-------
A no-holds-barred utility for reading files into memory.  And by
"no-holds-barred", I mean no error checking whatsoever (almost to the point of
absurdity).

Apparently this is [built in to Java 7][3], but some of us are stuck with
Java <= 6.

`URLGetter`
-----------
Fetch a given URL using the given method (and optionally sending the given
request body).
